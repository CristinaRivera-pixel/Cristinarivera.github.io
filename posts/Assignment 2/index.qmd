Assignment 2

For Assignment 2 I made a few graphics that utilizes the [Happy planet data set](https://happyplanetindex.org)

Everywhere I looked, it said that pie graphs were not great ways of representing data for a few reasons, one of them being that its not a great way for the viewer to precisely see which slices are bigger or smaller. But for this example I think it was fine especially since there were some regions that were a lot more represented then others.

I thought it might be interesting to look at this graph to see if there was anything that stuck out immediately and i was surprised that even though it generally trends up for GDP and life expectancy, it wasn't as linear of a relation as expected.
