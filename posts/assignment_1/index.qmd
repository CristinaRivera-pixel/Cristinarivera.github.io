This is a chart that is illustrating the average commute time in America. I just wanted to point out a few observations about this chart. Made by TitleMax using cenus.gov and trulia.com as their sources.

1.  Colors

    -   The first thing that stands out to me is the yellow color which first brings our attention first to which states have the longest commute time in cars which is the primary method of transportation for most people (with the exception for some cities)

2.  The font

    -   The font is clear and legible. The colors are properly contrasting along the border to bring attention to the most important parts without distracting the reader too much

3.  The Graph itself

    -   Very rich in Data. It uses many different types of visualizations for example, it uses a heat map so that you can quickly locate the states with the longest commutes, labeled cities of the longest commutes and the shortest commutes. The compactness of the graph and the amount of data could be distracting.
